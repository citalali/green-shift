          We are a young, international and passionate design thinking team
          studying at HPI Potsdam. With backgrounds from psychology, art, film
          making, law, social work and IT. To bring customers and small business
          owners together, we created Greenshift, a mapping service where small
          businesses can create a profile and have their shops displayed on a
          map for customers to discover. With this, Greenshift helps customers
          wanting to shop more unique, local and sustainable to navigate through
          the jungle of big brands and greenwashing to find great products right
          on their doorstep. Whether app or website, Greenshift shows you where
          small businesses are in your city, what products they sell, how long
          they are open and, of course, the fastest way to get there.
