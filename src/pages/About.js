      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        We are a group of students from the D-School in Postdam, Germany. We are
        currently working on a project for the course "Design Thinking Basic
        Track".
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to create a platform that helps people to find artists and
        small business they would normally not find.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are still in the early stages of development, but we are working hard
        to make this project a reality.
      </p>
      <p>If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at </p>
